  <h1 id="pilr-tutorial">PiLR Tutorial</h1>
<p>This tutorial will guide you through setting up a project that will
collect some simple GPS location data from a smartphone application.</p>
<h2 id="create-account">Create Account</h2>
<h2 id="login">Login</h2>
<h2 id="launch-project-wizard">Launch Project Wizard</h2>
<p>Visit PilR Health Home by clicking on the logo in the upper-left
corner of the page. To create a new project, just click the &#39;+ New
project...&#39; link under the list of projects on the right hand side of
of the Home screen.</p>
<p>You have just launched the &#39;Create a New Project&#39; wizard. Your just a
few steps away from collecting and viewing data with PiLR. </p>
<h3 id="step-1-name-the-project">Step 1: Name the project</h3>
<p>Every project needs a name, and here is where we can define it. Simply
type some text in the &#39;Name&#39; field. As you&#39;re entering the name,
notice how the &#39;Code&#39; field is automatically changing? The &#39;Code&#39;
field will be used by your web brower to show you specific information
about your project, so it needs to have a special format. Don&#39;t worry
though, PiLR automatically constructs a valid &#39;Code&#39; for you based on
the &#39;Name&#39;. When you&#39;re happy with your project&#39;s name, click the
&#39;Next&#39; button.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-structure-the-project">Step 2: Structure the Project</h3>
<p>While PiLR is extremely versatile, you can also quickly setup projects
based on common configurations. For this tutorial, let&#39;s use an
existing project structure. Leave the first option selected &quot;Start
with a defined project structure&quot;, and select Location Tracking -
Example 1&quot; from the dropdown. Then click &#39;Next&#39;.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-some-help-getting-started">Step 3: Some help getting started</h3>
<p>We can add an initial study participant in this step. First, check the
&#39;Add an initial participant&#39; box. There are now three fields to fill
in related to adding a participant. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Add an initial participant</p>
<p>In the &#39;Participant ID&#39; field, you can add a code to reference the
participant. For a given study, you will probably want to devise a
plan to label participant&#39;s in a meaningul way. Perhaps simply
increasing numerically, or perhaps based on a treatment group that
they will be part of. Let&#39;s just label this Participant <em>100</em> to keep
things simple.</p>
<p>Enter something like &quot;PiLR Tutorial Participant&quot; in the &#39;Participant Description&#39; field. In general, you can put whatever text
you want in this field, it&#39;s just there to help you out.</p>
<p>  Next, click on the empty box next to &#39;Active period start
date&#39;. We&#39;ll learn what that term means soon. A calendar will display,
and have today&#39;s date highlighted in blue. Simply click the blue date
(i.e., today&#39;s date).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>   Recall that this project is going to collect data from a smartphone
   application. That application will be installed on a device, and
   needs to be associated with the participant we just created above
   (Participant 100). In this step, we&#39;ll create the login information
   that the phone will need to write data to the PiLR system. If you
   were enrolling actual participants in a study using this smartphone
   application, you&#39;d need to either configure the application for
   them using this information, or provide the information to them
   directly. This information ensures the application can only see
   information related to <em>this</em> participant.</p>
<p>Click &#39;Finish&#39; and you&#39;re ready to start collecting data. </p>
<h3 id="step-4-setup-the-location-app">Step 4: Setup the Location app</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Install the application from &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter the participant access code information defined in step 3.2 above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
